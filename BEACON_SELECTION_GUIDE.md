2. **Clear All** - Deselects all beacons  
3. **First 10** - Selects the first 10 beacons alphabetically

### 📏 **Range Selection**

### 📋 **Visual Selection Grid**

For smaller beacon lists (≤20 beacons):

### 🎨 **Advanced Selection Options**

In the "Advanced Selection" expander:

## 💡 **Tips for Efficient Selection**

1. **Use Search First**: Filter down the list before making range selections
2. **Smart Select**: Great for getting started with quality beacons
3. **Range Selection**: Perfect for selecting consecutive beacons (e.g., Beacon_01 to Beacon_15)
4. **Pattern Selection**: Useful for selecting beacons with similar naming (e.g., all beacons containing "Zone_A")

## 🔄 **Session Memory**

The app remembers your beacon selection throughout your session, so you can:
- Navigate between different time ranges without losing your selection
- Use quick buttons to modify your existing selection
- Build complex selections step by step

## ⚡ **Performance Notes**

- Smart selection analyzes data quality in real-time
- For large beacon lists, use search and filters first
